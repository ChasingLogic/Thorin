# Chattie

A Python bot framework inspired by Hubot.

## How do I make my own bot using this?

First install chattie using `pip3 install chattie` you then will have
access to the chattie cli which generates and runs bots. Next you can
create a new bot using `chattie new my_bot_name` this will create a
new directory with the bot name and generate a few files to help you
get started!

From there you can start by adding [tricks](#tricks)
and [handlers](#handlers) or just running the bot with the default
connectors!

## Why the name Chattie?

It's based on the movie Chappie, whose main character is a robot who
gains emotions and befriends some humans. I've never seen the movie
but I thought the pun was worthy.
